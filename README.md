## Virtual Environment
To better run this project, one may set up a virtual environment on their computer.
* Create
1. Open a command prompt (cmd, conda, etc.)
1. Change your directory to your desired folder
1. Type the following into the command prompt:
> python -m venv name_of_your_virtual_environment
** A popular name of a virtual environment is simply `venv`

* Activate / Deactivate
Now that your virtual environment is created, we can activate and deactivate it at will.
1. Type the following command to activate your virtual environment:
** Windows:
> name_of_your_virtual_environment\Scripts\activate
** Mac / Linux
> $ source myvenv/bin/activate
1. After a second or two, your virtual environment is now alive!.
1. To deactivate it, simply type `deactivate` as a command in the command prompt

* Install Packages
Using `pip`, we can easliy install packages onto our virtual environment.
1. If you know what the name of the package is, simply type the following onto an activated virtual environment:
> pip install name_of_package
